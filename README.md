# RemindMe-Mobile-Application
RemindMe is a mobile application made using Python and Kivy Material design software
RemindME is an android based mobile application that accommodates all sorts of everyday requirements for which a person may need to install multiple applications. RemindME, here, plays the role of a versatile application, satisfying all of these requirements as a universal reminder app. The application is divided into 6 components; namely  the Home, Notes, Draw, Alarm, Event, List screens.

Home Screen: The home serves as a welcome to all the users and is also equipped with a theme changer, allowing the users to better their experience by customizing the color notations in the app as per what they feel looks good (but we feel that the default color notations seem to merge best with the application layout). Along with the theme changer, all screens, including the home screen are equipped with an instructions dialog box, which can be accessed through the icon button in the top toolbar.

Notes Screen: The notes component of the application allows users to make multiline notes in whatever quantity they require, the screen is scrollable, so the number of notes created by the user won't cause any problem. The + NEW NOTE button adds a new note to the screen, each note (multiline) being typed on by tapping(clicking) on it.

Draw Screen: Itâ€™s well known that pictographic memory serves as a much better tool to remember things as compared to its textual-based counterpart. RemindME is also equipped with a drawing tool to make drawing notes, which can be cleared every time they have been used and are no longer required. The users can draw whatever and wherever they want on the screen. When they no longer require the drawing note, they can simply press the clear button located at the bottom left to clear the screen.

Alarm Screen: The alarm page allows users to create alarms and stack them on a single page. This page again is scrollable, and the number of alarms created won't cause any problem. The + ADD ALARM button opens the alarm clock, on which we can input the time the alarm is to be scheduled, each alarm is accompanied by a note (multiline) which is typed on by tapping(clicking) on it.

Event Screen: Similar to the alarm page, the calendar page allows users to create and store their events. The + NEW EVENT button opens the alarm clock, on which we can input the date  the event is to be scheduled, each event is accompanied by a note (multiline) which is typed on by tapping(clicking) on it.

List Screen: Lastly, the list page allows users to create and arrange items along with their quantities in a grid layout, making shopping much more convenient. The two text fields in the bottom of the screen are to input the name and quantity of the items respectively, and the + ADD ITEM button is to add the item to the list.
